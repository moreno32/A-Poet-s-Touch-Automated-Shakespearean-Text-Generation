Project Title: "A Poet's Touch: Automated Shakespearean Text Generation"

Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to build a deep learning model that can generate text similar to that of the great playwright, William Shakespeare. Using a dataset of Shakespeare's sonnets, we will train a language generation model using Python and Tensorflow. The goal is to produce new text that captures the essence of Shakespeare's style, with its unique syntax, rhyme, and meter.

Project Motivation:
Shakespeare's writing is renowned for its beauty and timeless appeal. However, creating such text requires a high degree of skill and creativity. With the advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing, we now have the capability to automate this process, making Shakespeare's literary brilliance accessible to a wider audience. This project is a step in that direction, exploring the potential of deep learning models to generate Shakespearean text.

Learning Objectives:

Develop a deep understanding of text generation models and their applications.
Gain hands-on experience in implementing deep learning models using Tensorflow.
Learn about the importance of data pre-processing and feature extraction for text generation models.
Explore the creative potential of deep learning models in the domain of literature.

Technical Aspects:
The project will involve the following technical steps:

Data Collection: We will use the sonnets dataset from the Folger Shakespeare Library, available for free download.
Data Cleansing: The data will be cleaned and pre-processed to remove any extraneous information and prepare it for modeling.
Tokenization: The text will be tokenized, and a vocabulary will be built to represent the words in the dataset.
Model Training: We will use the GloVe embeddings, pre-trained on a large corpus of text, as a starting point for our language generation model. The model will be trained using Tensorflow.
Visualization: The generated text will be compared to the original Shakespearean text to evaluate the model's performance.

Data Source:
The data for this project will be obtained from the Folger Shakespeare Library's collection of Shakespeare's sonnets, available for free download.

Project Structure:
The project will be structured as follows:
